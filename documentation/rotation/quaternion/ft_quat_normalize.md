# ft_quat_normalize
Normalizes a quaternion to have a unit norm, which is essential for the quaternion to accurately represent a rotation in 3D space.

### Parameters
- `t_quat q`: The quaternion to be normalized.

### Function Details
This function calculates the norm (magnitude) of the quaternion and then divides each component by this norm:
- **Norm Calculation**: The norm is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of all components (w, x, y, z).
- **Normalization**: Each component of the quaternion is divided by the norm, ensuring the resultant quaternion has a norm of 1.

### Returns
- `t_quat`: The normalized quaternion. If the input quaternion is already of unit length or the norm calculation returns zero, the function handles these cases gracefully.

### Example Usage
```c
t_quat quat = {0.0, 3.0, 4.0, 0.0}; // Example non-normalized quaternion
t_quat normalizedQuat = ft_quat_normalize(quat);
// normalizedQuat will be approximately {0.0, 0.6, 0.8, 0.0}
```

### Notes:
- Normalizing a quaternion is crucial when using quaternions for rotation, as non-normalized quaternions can lead to errors in rotation computations and graphical rendering.
- If the norm of the quaternion is zero, the function should handle it appropriately, typically returning the original quaternion or a designated error state.
