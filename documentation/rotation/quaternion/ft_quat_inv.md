# ft_quat_inv
Calculates the inverse of a quaternion. The inverse of a quaternion represents a rotation in the opposite direction, effectively "undoing" the original rotation.

### Parameters
- `t_quat q`: The quaternion for which to compute the inverse.

### Function Details
The inverse of a quaternion \(q\) is calculated as follows:
- **Norm Calculation**: Compute the norm \(n\) of the quaternion, which is the sum of the squares of all its components (w, x, y, z).
- **Inverse Components**: The inverse is calculated by dividing each component of the conjugate of the quaternion by its norm. The conjugate of a quaternion is obtained by negating its vector part (x, y, z) while keeping the scalar part (w) unchanged.

### Returns
- `t_quat`: The quaternion representing the inverse of the input quaternion.

### Example Usage
***c
t_quat quat = {1, 0, 1, 0}; // Example quaternion
t_quat inverseQuat = ft_quat_inv(quat);
// inverseQuat will be the quaternion that, when multiplied by 'quat', results in the identity quaternion {1, 0, 0, 0}
***

### Notes:
- If the quaternion is a unit quaternion (common in rotation representations), the inverse is equivalent to its conjugate. For non-unit quaternions, dividing by the norm ensures the inverse is also a unit quaternion.
- It's crucial to ensure the quaternion is not zero (where all components are zero) as this would lead to division by zero.
