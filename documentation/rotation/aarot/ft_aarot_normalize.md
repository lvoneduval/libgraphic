# ft_aarot_normalize
Normalizes the axis of an axis-angle rotation to ensure it is a unit vector, while keeping the rotation angle the same.

### Parameters
- `t_aarot rot`: The axis-angle rotation to normalize.

### Function Details
This function normalizes the axis part of an axis-angle rotation. The steps include:
- **Magnitude Calculation**: Computes the norm (magnitude) of the rotation axis using the Euclidean norm formula.
- **Normalization**: If the norm is greater than zero, each component of the axis (x, y, z) is divided by the norm to make it a unit vector.
- **Handling Zero Vectors**: If the norm is zero, indicating that the axis vector is a zero vector, the rotation is left unchanged to avoid division by zero errors.
- **Angle Preservation**: The rotation angle is directly transferred from the input rotation to the output without modification.

### Returns
- `t_aarot`: The normalized axis-angle rotation. If the input axis was a zero vector, the output will be the same as the input.

### Example Usage
```c
// Create an axis-angle rotation with a non-unit axis
t_aarot rotation = {2.0, 2.0, 2.0, M_PI};
// Normalize the rotation
t_aarot normalized_rotation = ft_aarot_normalize(rotation);
// normalized_rotation will have an axis of approximately (0.577, 0.577, 0.577) and an angle of Ï€
```

### Notes:
- Normalizing the rotation axis is crucial when the magnitude of the axis affects the behavior of rotation operations in graphics or physics engines.
- This function does not modify the angle component, as the magnitude of the rotation axis does not affect the rotation angle.
