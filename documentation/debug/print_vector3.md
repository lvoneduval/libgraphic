# print_vector3
Outputs the components of a 3D vector to the standard output, formatted with specified precision. This function is essential for developers needing to inspect or debug the precise values of 3D vectors in computational tasks or graphical rendering.

### Parameters
- `t_vector3 v`: The 3D vector to print, containing floating-point x, y, and z components.

### Function Details
This function prints the x, y, and z components of a 3D vector using the `FLOAT_PRECISION` constant to control the number of decimal places displayed. It's designed to provide a clear, readable output of vector values, which is especially useful in the debugging of 3D calculations where precision is crucial.

### Example Usage
```c
t_vector3 normal = {0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f};
print_vector3(normal);
```

### Output Format
- The vector is printed in a curly-braced format with each component separated by spaces, each formatted to the number of decimal places specified by `FLOAT_PRECISION`.

### Notes:
- **Precision Control**: The precision for displaying floating-point numbers can be crucial for accurately diagnosing issues in vector computations, ensuring that small but significant differences in vector components are visible.
- **Debugging and Verification**: Useful for verifying the results of vector transformations, normal calculations, or any operation involving 3D vectors.
- **Utility in Visualization**: While this function provides textual output, for comprehensive debugging in a visual context, consider using graphical tools that can represent vectors in a 3D space visually.
