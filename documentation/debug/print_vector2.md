# print_vector2
Outputs the components of a 2D vector to the standard output, using a specified precision for floating-point numbers. This function is valuable for debugging calculations involving 2D vectors, providing a clear and precise display of vector component values.

### Parameters
- `t_vector2 v`: The 2D vector to print, containing floating-point x and y components.

### Function Details
This function formats the x and y components of a 2D vector and prints them with the precision specified by the global `FLOAT_PRECISION` constant. It's designed to help developers see the exact values used in computations, particularly useful in the precision-sensitive context of graphics and physics calculations.

### Example Usage
```c
t_vector2 direction = {0.707f, 0.707f};
print_vector2(direction);
```

### Output Format
- The vector is printed in a curly-braced format with each component separated by spaces, formatted to the number of decimal places specified by `FLOAT_PRECISION`.
- Example output given `FLOAT_PRECISION` is 2: `{0.71 0.71}`.

### Notes:
- **Precision Importance**: Floating-point precision is critical in many applications involving vectors, such as transformations, animations, and other graphical computations. This function ensures that precision is visually maintained in outputs.
- **Debugging Tool**: Primarily used as a debugging aid to verify vector operations, this function can be instrumental in troubleshooting issues in vector manipulation algorithms.
- **Visualization**: While useful for console output, consider additional tools or methods for visual representation in graphical or interactive applications.
