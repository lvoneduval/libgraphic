# print_quat
Prints the components of a quaternion to the standard output, formatted with specified precision. This function is particularly useful for debugging and visualizing quaternion values used in 3D rotations and transformations.

### Parameters
- `t_quat q`: The quaternion to print, comprising the scalar part \(w\) and the vector part \(x, y, z\).

### Function Details
This function displays the quaternion's components in a structured format that includes the scalar (real) part and the vector (imaginary) part. The `FLOAT_PRECISION` constant controls the number of decimal places, aiding in precise and readable output.

### Example Usage
```c
t_quat rotation = {1.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f};
print_quat(rotation);
```

### Output Format
- The quaternion is printed in the format: `(w){x y z}`, where each component is separated by spaces and formatted to the specified number of decimal places using `FLOAT_PRECISION`.
- Example output for `FLOAT_PRECISION` set to 2: `(1.00){0.00 1.00 0.00}`.

### Notes:
- **Precision Importance**: High precision is crucial when working with quaternions due to their use in sensitive mathematical operations, such as 3D rotations where rounding errors can lead to significant inaccuracies.
- **Debugging Tool**: This function is a vital tool for developers working with 3D transformations, as it allows for the direct observation and verification of quaternion values.
- **Use Case**: Often used in graphics and physics engines to verify the correctness of quaternion-based rotations and interpolations.
