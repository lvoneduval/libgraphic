# ft_vector3_equal
Determines if two 3D vectors are exactly equal by comparing their x, y, and z components. This function is essential for operations where precise vector equality is crucial, such as in geometric algorithms or when validating conditions in simulations.

### Parameters
- `t_vector3 v1`: The first vector to compare.
- `t_vector3 v2`: The second vector to compare.

### Function Details
This function compares the components of two vectors:
- **Component Comparison**: It checks if both the x, y, and z components of `v1` are equal to those of `v2`.
  - If all components match, the vectors are considered equal.
  - If any component does not match, the vectors are not equal.

### Returns
- `int`: Returns `1` if the vectors are equal, `0` otherwise.

### Example Usage
```c
t_vector3 vectorA = {3.0, 4.0, 5.0};
t_vector3 vectorB = {3.0, 4.0, 5.0};
int areEqual = ft_vector3_equal(vectorA, vectorB);
// areEqual will be 1, indicating that vectorA and vectorB are exactly the same
```

### Notes:
- **Usage Considerations**: Exact equality checks are sensitive to floating-point precision issues. For applications involving floating-point calculations, consider using a tolerance for equality checks to avoid unexpected results.
- **Efficiency**: This function is optimized for quick comparison, useful in algorithms that require frequent vector equality checks, such as searching and sorting in geometric data structures.
