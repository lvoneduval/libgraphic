# ft_vector3_null
Initializes a 3D vector to a zero vector, where all components (x, y, and z) are set to zero. This operation is essential for creating a baseline vector with no magnitude or direction.

### Parameters
None

### Function Details
This function sets all components of the vector to zero:
- **X Component**: Set to 0.
- **Y Component**: Set to 0.
- **Z Component**: Set to 0.

### Returns
- `t_vector3`: The resulting zero vector, often used as a neutral element in vector operations.

### Example Usage
```c
t_vector3 zeroVector = ft_vector3_null();
// zeroVector now has x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0, representing a vector with no direction or magnitude
```

### Notes:
- **Utility**: Zero vectors are used in algorithms as initial values or to represent a state of no movement or direction. They are also used in conditions to check if vector operations have resulted in a vector with no effect.
- **Identity for Addition**: In vector addition, the zero vector acts as an identity element; adding it to any vector results in the original vector.
