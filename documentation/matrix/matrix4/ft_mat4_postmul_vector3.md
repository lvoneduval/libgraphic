# ft_mat4_postmul_vector3
Performs post-multiplication of a 3D vector by a 4x4 matrix. This operation is essential in 3D graphics for transforming vectors according to a matrix that represents combined transformations including scaling, rotation, and translation.

### Parameters
- `t_vector3 v`: The vector to be transformed.
- `t_matrix4 m`: The transformation matrix.

### Function Details
This function calculates the product of the vector `v` and the matrix `m` where the vector is multiplied by the matrix from the right (vector-matrix multiplication):
- **Matrix-Vector Multiplication**: Each component of the resulting vector (`dst`) is calculated as a dot product of the vector and the corresponding matrix column:
  - **X Component**: Combines the vector with the first column of the matrix.
  - **Y Component**: Combines the vector with the second column of the matrix.
  - **Z Component**: Combines the vector with the third column of the matrix.

### Returns
- `t_vector3`: The transformed vector resulting from the post-multiplication of `v` by `m`.

### Example Usage
```c
t_vector3 originalVector = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0};
t_matrix4 transformationMatrix = {{1, 0, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 1, 0}, {1, 2, 3, 1}};
t_vector3 transformedVector = ft_mat4_postmul_vector3(originalVector, transformationMatrix);
// transformedVector now holds the new coordinates of the vector after transformation
```

### Notes:
- **Application in Graphics**: This function is crucial for applying transformations to vertices in a 3D scene, allowing for complex manipulations like moving objects, resizing, or rotating them within the scene.
- **Combination of Transformations**: The matrix used can represent a combination of different transformations, which are applied to the vector in a single operation.
