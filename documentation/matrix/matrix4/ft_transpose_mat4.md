# ft_transpose_mat4
Transposes a 4x4 matrix, swapping its rows and columns. This function is crucial for various mathematical operations in graphics programming, particularly when converting between row-major and column-major matrix representations.

### Parameters
- `t_matrix4 m`: The matrix to be transposed.

### Function Details
This function iterates over the matrix elements, swapping the rows and columns:
- **Loop Structure**: Utilizes nested loops to traverse the matrix and swap elements across the diagonal.
- **Efficiency**: Operates in-place to minimize additional memory overhead, ensuring efficient execution for graphics and computational tasks.

### Returns
- `t_matrix4`: The transposed matrix.

### Example Usage
```c
t_matrix4 originalMatrix = {{1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7, 8}, {9, 10, 11, 12}, {13, 14, 15, 16}};
t_matrix4 transposedMatrix = ft_transpose_mat4(originalMatrix);
```

### Notes:
- **Applications**: Transposing is particularly useful when interfacing with different graphics APIs that may require a different matrix layout (row-major vs. column-major).
- **Mathematical Operations**: Often used in mathematical calculations involving matrix multiplication, inversion, and solving systems of linear equations.
