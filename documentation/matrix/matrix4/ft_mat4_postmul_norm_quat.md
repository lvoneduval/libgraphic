# ft_mat4_postmul_norm_quat
Performs post-multiplication of a quaternion by a 4x4 matrix and normalizes the result. This function is essential in scenarios where a quaternion, representing a rotation, needs to be transformed by a matrix and then used in a normalized form to avoid scaling effects on the rotation.

### Parameters
- `t_quat q`: The original quaternion to be transformed.
- `t_matrix4 m`: The transformation matrix.

### Function Details
This function multiplies a quaternion by a matrix, combining the transformation encoded in the matrix with the rotation represented by the quaternion:
- **Quaternion-Matrix Multiplication**: Each component of the resulting quaternion (`dst`) is calculated by the dot product of the quaternion with each row of the matrix:
  - **X Component**: Combines all components of the quaternion with the first row of the matrix.
  - **Y Component**: Combines all components of the quaternion with the second row of the matrix.
  - **Z Component**: Combines all components of the quaternion with the third row of the matrix.
  - **W Component**: Combines all components of the quaternion with the fourth row of the matrix.
- **Normalization**: After multiplication, if the w-component of the quaternion is not 1.0 or 0.0, the entire quaternion is normalized by dividing each component by the w-component. This step ensures the quaternion remains valid for representing rotations without scaling distortions.

### Returns
- `t_quat`: The normalized quaternion resulting from the multiplication and normalization process.

### Example Usage
```c
t_quat originalQuat = {0.0, 0.7, 0.7, 0.0}; // Example quaternion
t_matrix4 transformMatrix = {{1, 0, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 1}}; // Identity matrix for simplicity
t_quat transformedQuat = ft_mat4_postmul_norm_quat(originalQuat, transformMatrix);
// transformedQuat will contain the normalized quaternion after the transformation
```

### Notes:
- **Importance of Normalization**: Normalizing the quaternion after transformation is crucial to maintain its mathematical correctness for representing rotations. Failure to normalize can result in incorrect behavior when the quaternion is used to rotate objects.
- **Use Cases**: Particularly useful in computer graphics, robotics, and simulation where precise and correct rotational transformations are required.
