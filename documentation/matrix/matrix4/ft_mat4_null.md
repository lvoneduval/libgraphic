# ft_mat4_null
Creates and returns a 4x4 matrix initialized to zero, effectively serving as a null matrix in transformations.

### Parameters
None

### Function Details
This function initializes all elements of a 4x4 matrix to zero. The primary use of a null matrix in graphical applications is to represent the absence of any transformation.

### Returns
- `t_matrix4`: A matrix where all elements are set to zero.

### Example Usage
```c
t_matrix4 matrix = ft_mat4_null();
// Now `matrix` is a 4x4 matrix where every element is 0.0
```

### Notes:
- A null matrix can be used as a base for constructing other matrices, such as transformation matrices in graphics or for initializing matrices in a system that requires a zero state before setting specific values.
