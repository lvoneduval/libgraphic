# ft_mat4_premul_quat
Performs pre-multiplication of a quaternion by a 4x4 matrix. This method is crucial in graphics and physics for transforming quaternions, which represent orientations and rotations, using a transformation matrix.

### Parameters
- `t_matrix4 m`: The transformation matrix.
- `t_quat q`: The quaternion to be transformed.

### Function Details
This function computes the multiplication of a matrix by a quaternion (matrix-quaternion multiplication) where the matrix affects the quaternion's components:
- **Matrix-Quaternion Multiplication**: Each component of the resulting quaternion (`dst`) is calculated by multiplying the quaternion's components with the corresponding matrix row, effectively applying the matrix transformation to the quaternion:
  - **X Component**: Combines the first column of the matrix with the quaternion.
  - **Y Component**: Combines the second column of the matrix with the quaternion.
  - **Z Component**: Combines the third column of the matrix with the quaternion.
  - **W Component**: Combines the fourth column of the matrix with the quaternion.

### Returns
- `t_quat`: The transformed quaternion resulting from the pre-multiplication of the quaternion `q` by the matrix `m`.

### Example Usage
```c
t_matrix4 rotationMatrix = { /* Matrix elements initializing here */ };
t_quat originalQuat = {0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0};
t_quat transformedQuat = ft_mat4_premul_quat(rotationMatrix, originalQuat);
// transformedQuat now holds the new values of the quaternion after transformation
```

### Notes:
- **Application in Animations**: Often used in 3D animations and simulations where quaternions are preferred over Euler angles to avoid gimbal lock and provide smoother interpolations.
- **Order of Operations**: It's critical to apply transformations in the correct sequence when dealing with matrix and quaternion operations to achieve the desired rotational effects.
