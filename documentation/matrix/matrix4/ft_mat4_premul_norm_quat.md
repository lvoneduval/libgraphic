# ft_mat4_premul_norm_quat
Performs pre-multiplication of a quaternion by a 4x4 matrix and normalizes the result. This function is critical in scenarios where a quaternion, representing a rotation, needs to be transformed by a matrix and then normalized to maintain unit length.

### Parameters
- `t_matrix4 m`: The transformation matrix.
- `t_quat q`: The quaternion to be transformed and normalized.

### Function Details
This function computes the multiplication of a matrix by a quaternion and then normalizes the resulting quaternion:
- **Matrix-Quaternion Multiplication**: Each component of the resulting quaternion (`dst`) is calculated by combining the matrix's columns with the quaternion's components, similarly to the standard matrix-quaternion multiplication.
- **Normalization**: After the multiplication, if the resulting quaternion's scalar part (`w`) is not 1.0 and not 0.0, the entire quaternion is normalized. This is to ensure the quaternion remains a unit quaternion, which is necessary for it to represent a rotation properly.

### Returns
- `t_quat`: The transformed and normalized quaternion.

### Example Usage
```c
t_matrix4 transformMatrix = { /* Initialize matrix elements */ };
t_quat rotationQuat = {0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5};
t_quat normalizedQuat = ft_mat4_premul_norm_quat(transformMatrix, rotationQuat);
// normalizedQuat will hold the normalized quaternion after transformation
```

### Notes:
- **Importance of Normalization**: Keeping quaternions normalized after transformations is crucial to avoid errors in subsequent rotational calculations and to ensure the stability of rotational behaviors in simulations and animations.
- **Efficiency Considerations**: Normalization involves a division operation, which may be computationally expensive. Ensure this operation is necessary for your application to optimize performance.
