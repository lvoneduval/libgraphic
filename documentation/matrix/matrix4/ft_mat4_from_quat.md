# ft_mat4_from_quat
Converts a quaternion into a 4x4 rotation matrix. This function is fundamental in 3D graphics for applying quaternion rotations to objects using matrix transformations.

### Parameters
- `t_quat q`: The quaternion representing a rotation. Quaternions are often used in graphics due to their computational efficiency and lack of gimbal lock.

### Function Details
This function constructs a rotation matrix from a quaternion by applying the mathematical relationships between quaternion components and matrix elements:
- **First Row Calculation**: Incorporates the quaternion's x, y, z, and w components to calculate the first row of the matrix.
- **Second Row Calculation**: Based on the quaternion values, calculates the second row.
- **Third Row Calculation**: Completes the third row using the quaternion's components.
- **Homogeneous Part**: Sets the last row and column to represent no translation (homogeneous coordinates for rotation matrices).

### Returns
- `t_matrix4`: The resulting rotation matrix that can be used to apply the quaternion's rotation in a matrix-based graphics pipeline.

### Example Usage
***c
t_quat rotationQuat = {0.0, 0.707, 0.707, 0.0}; // Quaternion for a 90-degree rotation around the Y-axis
t_matrix4 rotationMatrix = ft_mat4_from_quat(rotationQuat);
***

### Notes:
- **Efficiency**: Using quaternions for rotations avoids issues like gimbal lock and provides a more numerically stable method compared to Euler angles.
- **Application**: This matrix can be used directly in graphics APIs that support matrix transformations to rotate objects in 3D space.
