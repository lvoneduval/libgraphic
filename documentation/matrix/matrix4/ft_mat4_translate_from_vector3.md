# ft_mat4_translate_from_vector3
Creates a 4x4 translation matrix from a 3D vector, allowing for positional transformations of objects in 3D space. This matrix shifts an object by the vector's components along the respective x, y, and z axes.

### Parameters
- `t_vector3 v`: The vector representing the translation distances along the x, y, and z axes.

### Function Details
This function initializes a translation matrix based on the provided vector:
- **Identity Matrix**: Starts with an identity matrix which represents no transformation.
- **Setting Translation Components**: Modifies the fourth column of the matrix to include the translation values provided by the vector `v`. This effectively moves the position of objects when the matrix is applied to their vertices.

### Returns
- `t_matrix4`: A translation matrix that can be used to move objects in 3D space according to the specified vector.

### Example Usage
```c
t_vector3 translationVector = {3.0, 5.0, 2.0};  // Move 3 units on x, 5 units on y, 2 units on z
t_matrix4 translationMatrix = ft_mat4_translate_from_vector3(translationVector);
```

### Notes:
- **Usage in Graphics**: Translation matrices are fundamental in graphics programming for moving objects, setting camera positions, or adjusting scenes.
- **Matrix Operations**: This matrix can be combined with other transformations (rotation, scaling) by matrix multiplication to achieve complex transformation sequences.
