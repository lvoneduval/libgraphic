# ft_mat4_from_aarot
Generates a 4x4 rotation matrix from an axis-angle rotation structure. This matrix is used to apply a rotation transformation in 3D graphics based on a specified axis and angle.

### Parameters
- `t_aarot rot`: The axis-angle rotation structure containing the axis of rotation (x, y, z) and the angle in radians.

### Function Details
This function first normalizes the rotation axis to ensure it is a unit vector. It then uses the Rodrigues' rotation formula to construct a rotation matrix. The formula involves trigonometric functions to compute the rotation about a unit axis:
- **Sine and Cosine Calculations**: Compute sine and cosine of the rotation angle.
- **Component Calculations**: Use the components of the normalized axis to fill in the rotation matrix based on the Rodrigues' formula.

### Returns
- `t_matrix4`: The resulting rotation matrix that can be used to transform 3D coordinates.

### Example Usage
```c
t_aarot rotation = {1.0, 0.0, 0.0, M_PI / 2}; // Rotate 90 degrees around the x-axis
t_matrix4 rotationMatrix = ft_mat4_from_aarot(rotation);
```

### Notes:
- It is crucial that the axis provided is normalizable (non-zero length) to avoid division by zero during normalization.
- This function is pivotal for implementing 3D rotations where precision and correctness are critical, especially in rendering and animation.
