# ft_mat4_postmul_quat
Performs post-multiplication of a quaternion by a 4x4 matrix. This operation is essential in simulations and 3D graphics for transforming quaternions, which are used to represent orientations and rotations.

### Parameters
- `t_quat q`: The quaternion to be transformed.
- `t_matrix4 m`: The transformation matrix.

### Function Details
This function computes the multiplication of the quaternion `q` by the matrix `m` from the right (quaternion-matrix multiplication):
- **Quaternion-Matrix Multiplication**: Each component of the resulting quaternion (`dst`) is calculated by combining the quaternion's components with the corresponding matrix column:
  - **X Component**: Calculated as a weighted sum of the quaternion's components using the first column of the matrix.
  - **Y Component**: Uses the second column of the matrix.
  - **Z Component**: Uses the third column of the matrix.
  - **W Component**: Uses the fourth column of the matrix.

### Returns
- `t_quat`: The transformed quaternion resulting from the post-multiplication of `q` by `m`.

### Example Usage
```c
t_quat originalQuat = {0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0};  // A quaternion representing a 90-degree rotation around the Y-axis
t_matrix4 transformMatrix = {{1, 0, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 0, 1}};  // A transformation matrix (e.g., another rotation or scaling)
t_quat transformedQuat = ft_mat4_postmul_quat(originalQuat, transformMatrix);
// transformedQuat will contain the quaternion after being transformed by the matrix
```

### Notes:
- **Transformation Order**: The order of operations is crucial in quaternion and matrix transformations; this function applies the matrix to the quaternion in a post-multiplication manner.
- **Use Cases**: Often used in 3D animations, virtual reality, and wherever quaternions are used to represent rotations and orientations that need to be modified by transformation matrices.
