# ft_mat4_identity
Creates a 4x4 identity matrix. An identity matrix in graphics is used as a default matrix for transformations, effectively representing 'no transformation'.

### Parameters
None

### Function Details
This function initializes a 4x4 matrix to the identity matrix:
- **Diagonal Values**: Sets all diagonal values (top left to bottom right) to 1. These represent the scale of each axis, with a value of 1 meaning no scaling.
- **Off-Diagonal Values**: All other values are set to 0, indicating no skewing, rotation, or translation between the axes.

### Returns
- `t_matrix4`: The resulting identity matrix.

### Example Usage
```c
t_matrix4 identityMatrix = ft_mat4_identity();
// identityMatrix can now be used as a base for further transformations or as a default state for rendering calculations.
```

### Notes:
- **Use in Graphics**: The identity matrix is used extensively in graphics programming to initialize transformation matrices or to reset transformations during complex operations like scene rendering or animation.
- **Mathematical Properties**: The identity matrix is the neutral element of matrix multiplication (similar to 0 for addition or 1 for multiplication in arithmetic), meaning any matrix multiplied by the identity matrix will result in the original matrix.
